Now you may ask Why cant we download 1080p and above ?? 
Yes you can absoulutely download it but 

YouTube uses Dash streams for higher-quality rendering.
Progressive streams are limited to 720p and it contains both audio and video codec files while Dash streams have higher quality but only have video codecs.
But, for the higher quality, we should use Dash streams for video and should also download an audio stream and then later merge them using any mixing tool.
So, for this article, we will be using progressive stream download to get ready to play videos.

6. STEP 6:
Click on the Download button and after few seconds, A green text stating "Download Completed" shows up, like this
